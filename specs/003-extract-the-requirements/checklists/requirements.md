# Specification Quality Checklist: Remove Endpoint Validation to Enable Full API Access

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All validation items completed successfully

### Detailed Review:

**Content Quality** ✅
- Spec focuses on user scenarios and outcomes (querying enrollment data, unblocking endpoints)
- No specific technologies mentioned in requirements (preserves Zod/validation details only for context)
- Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes, not implementation
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Requirement Completeness** ✅
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are definitive
- Every FR is testable (e.g., FR-001: can test that requests pass through; FR-005: can verify no whitelist lookups)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: within 2 seconds; SC-002: 11 endpoints vs 1; SC-007: 15-30 hours/year → 0)
- All success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., "users can query" not "validation function returns")
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format for all 5 user stories
- Edge cases section addresses boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds what's excluded
- Dependencies and Assumptions sections comprehensively documented

**Feature Readiness** ✅
- User stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- 5 user stories cover: primary use case (enrollment queries), regression testing, error handling, developer experience, future-proofing
- Success criteria align with user stories (e.g., SC-002 supports User Story 1)
- Technical Context section mentions specific files/lines but only for reference, not as requirements

## Notes

- Spec successfully extracted requirements from comprehensive research document
- All 4 solution options from research were considered, with Option 1 (Remove Validation) selected based on clear criteria
- IPEDS endpoint catalog (11 verified endpoints) provides concrete evidence for success criteria
- Priority justified as P0-Critical based on 90% of queries blocked and zero workaround
- No clarifications needed - research document provided complete context for definitive requirements
