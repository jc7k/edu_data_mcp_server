# Feature Specification: Technical Debt Remediation and Architectural Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to address any technical debt in this codebase and review it for architectural improvements that can improve it's performance and security"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Code Maintainability and Modularity (Priority: P1)

As a developer maintaining this MCP server, I need the codebase to be modular and well-organized so that I can easily understand, test, and modify individual components without affecting the entire system.

**Why this priority**: The current 500+ line single-file architecture makes debugging difficult, prevents unit testing, and creates a high barrier for new contributors. This is the foundation for all other improvements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to modify a single component (e.g., endpoint validation logic) and verifying that changes are isolated to one module without requiring changes across the entire file. Delivers immediate value through easier debugging and reduced cognitive load.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the codebase is organized into separate modules, **When** a developer needs to modify the API client logic, **Then** they can locate and modify only the API client module without touching request handlers or server setup
2. **Given** the code has clear separation of concerns, **When** a new developer reviews the codebase, **Then** they can understand the purpose and responsibilities of each module within 15 minutes
3. **Given** components are modular, **When** running unit tests, **Then** each component can be tested in isolation without requiring the full server to be running

### User Story 2 - Input Validation and Security Hardening (Priority: P2)

As a server operator, I need the MCP server to validate and sanitize all inputs so that malicious or malformed requests cannot compromise the system or cause unexpected behavior.

**Why this priority**: Once the code is modular (P1), security improvements can be systematically applied to each component. Missing input validation is a critical security gap that must be addressed before performance optimizations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending malformed, malicious, or boundary-case inputs to each tool and verifying that appropriate error messages are returned without crashes or unexpected behavior. Delivers value by protecting the system from injection attacks and DoS attempts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user provides malicious input with special characters or injection attempts, **When** the server processes the request, **Then** the input is sanitized and rejected with a clear error message before reaching the external API
2. **Given** a user provides invalid parameter types or values, **When** the server validates the input, **Then** a descriptive error is returned identifying which parameters failed validation
3. **Given** a user attempts to request excessive data (e.g., limit > 10000), **When** the server receives the request, **Then** the request is rejected with guidance on acceptable limits
4. **Given** the server receives a request with missing required parameters, **When** validation occurs, **Then** all missing parameters are identified in a single error response

### User Story 3 - Error Handling and Observability (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I need comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can diagnose issues quickly and understand system behavior without requiring code changes.

**Why this priority**: Building on modular code (P1) and secure validation (P2), proper error handling provides operational visibility. This enables production monitoring and rapid troubleshooting.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering various error conditions (network failures, API errors, invalid inputs) and verifying that detailed logs are produced and errors are gracefully handled with appropriate user-facing messages. Delivers value through reduced mean-time-to-resolution for incidents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the external API returns an error, **When** the server processes the error, **Then** the original error context is logged while a user-friendly message is returned to the client
2. **Given** a network timeout occurs, **When** the server handles the timeout, **Then** a retry is attempted with exponential backoff before returning an error
3. **Given** an unexpected error occurs, **When** the server encounters the error, **Then** diagnostic information is logged (timestamp, request parameters, stack trace) without exposing sensitive data to the client
4. **Given** the server is running, **When** monitoring health, **Then** health check endpoints report system status and key metrics

---

### User Story 4 - Performance Optimization and Caching (Priority: P4)

As a user of the MCP server, I need fast response times for common queries so that I can work efficiently without waiting for repeated API calls to complete.

**Why this priority**: Performance optimizations should only be applied after the architecture is solid (P1-P3). Premature optimization on fragile code creates technical debt rather than solving it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making identical requests multiple times and verifying that subsequent requests are served from cache with sub-100ms response times. Delivers value by reducing API load and improving user experience for repeated queries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an endpoint has been queried recently, **When** the same query is made again within the cache TTL, **Then** the cached result is returned without calling the external API
2. **Given** the cache exceeds its size limit, **When** new entries are added, **Then** the least recently used entries are evicted automatically
3. **Given** cached data exists, **When** the cache TTL expires, **Then** the next request fetches fresh data from the API
4. **Given** multiple concurrent requests for the same endpoint occur, **When** the first request is still pending, **Then** subsequent requests wait for the first response rather than creating duplicate API calls

---

### User Story 5 - Testing Infrastructure and Quality Assurance (Priority: P5)

As a developer contributing to this codebase, I need automated tests and quality checks so that I can verify my changes don't break existing functionality and meet code quality standards.

**Why this priority**: Testing infrastructure is most valuable when applied to clean, modular, secure code (P1-P4). Tests written against poor architecture often become obsolete during refactoring.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the test suite and code quality checks via a single command and receiving a pass/fail report with coverage metrics. Delivers value by preventing regressions and enforcing consistency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the test suite is configured, **When** a developer runs tests locally, **Then** all unit and integration tests execute and report results within 30 seconds
2. **Given** code quality tools are configured, **When** a developer commits changes, **Then** linting and type checking automatically verify code meets standards
3. **Given** the codebase has test coverage, **When** reviewing coverage reports, **Then** critical paths (API calls, error handling, validation) have at least 80% test coverage
4. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** all tests and quality checks pass before allowing merge

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the external Education Data API is unreachable or returns 500 errors?
- How does the system handle extremely large result sets that exceed memory limits?
- What happens when concurrent requests cause race conditions in the endpoint cache?
- How does the system behave when provided with Unicode, emoji, or special characters in query parameters?
- What happens when upstream API changes its response format or introduces breaking changes?
- How does the system handle requests that take longer than typical timeout periods?
- What happens when malformed JSON or non-JSON responses are received from the API?
