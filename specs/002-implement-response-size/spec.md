# Feature Specification: Response Size Optimization and Pagination Controls

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-response-size`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement response size optimization and pagination controls to prevent massive token usage in MCP server responses"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Query Large Datasets Without Token Overflow (Priority: P1)

As an AI agent using the education data MCP server, I need to query large datasets (like all schools in a state) without receiving responses that exceed my context window or consume excessive tokens, so that I can successfully retrieve and process the data I need.

**Why this priority**: This is the critical issue causing the 4.4M token responses. Without fixing this, the server is unusable for realistic queries.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a query for school enrollment data filtered by state, and verifying that the response is under 10,000 tokens while still containing useful data with clear indication of whether more results exist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a query that would return 1000 schools, **When** the user makes a request without specifying a limit, **Then** the response contains a reasonable default number of results (e.g., 20) and includes metadata indicating total available records
2. **Given** a query for detailed school data, **When** the response is generated, **Then** the JSON is compact (no pretty-printing) and the total response size is under a configurable token threshold
3. **Given** a query that would exceed maximum result limits, **When** the user makes the request, **Then** the system returns an error with guidance on how to paginate or filter the query

### User Story 2 - Navigate Through Large Result Sets (Priority: P2)

As an AI agent querying education data, I need to retrieve results in manageable chunks and navigate through multiple pages of data, so that I can systematically process large datasets without overwhelming my context.

**Why this priority**: Once we prevent token overflow, users need a way to access the full dataset through pagination. This enables working with complete data while maintaining efficiency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making an initial query that returns page 1 with 20 results, then using the pagination metadata to request page 2, and verifying you receive the next 20 results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a dataset with 150 schools, **When** the user requests page 1 with limit=20, **Then** the response contains 20 schools and metadata showing total=150, current_page=1, has_more=true
2. **Given** the user is on page 2 of results, **When** they request the next page, **Then** they receive page 3 with the correct offset applied
3. **Given** a user requests a specific page number, **When** that page exceeds available results, **Then** the system returns an empty results array with clear metadata indicating they've exceeded available data

### User Story 3 - Control Response Detail Level (Priority: P3)

As an AI agent analyzing education data, I need to control which fields are included in the response, so that I can minimize token usage by receiving only the data I actually need for my analysis.

**Why this priority**: After implementing safe defaults and pagination, field selection provides further optimization for users who know exactly what data they need. This is a "nice to have" optimization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a query with field selection (e.g., only school name and enrollment) and verifying the response contains only those fields, significantly reducing response size compared to returning all fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user specifies fields=['name', 'enrollment'], **When** they query school data, **Then** the response contains only those two fields per school record
2. **Given** a user omits the fields parameter, **When** they query data, **Then** the response includes all available fields (backward compatible default)
3. **Given** a user specifies an invalid field name, **Then** the system returns an error listing available field names for that endpoint

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user requests limit=0 or a negative limit?
- How does the system handle pagination when the total dataset changes between page requests?
- What happens when a user requests page 1000 when only 100 pages exist?
- How does the system behave when the underlying API returns more results than expected?
- What happens if the API returns results that still exceed token limits even with pagination?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST enforce a default result limit of 20 records when no limit is specified
- **FR-002**: System MUST reject requests with limit values exceeding 1000 records
- **FR-003**: System MUST return JSON responses in compact format (no whitespace indentation)
- **FR-004**: System MUST include pagination metadata in all responses showing: total_count, current_page, page_size, has_more, next_page
- **FR-005**: System MUST support page-based navigation via page and limit parameters
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that requested page numbers and limits are positive integers
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages when queries would exceed maximum response size thresholds
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate estimated response size and warn users before exceeding configurable thresholds
- **FR-009**: System MUST support offset-based pagination as an alternative to page-based pagination
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to specify which fields to include in responses via optional fields parameter
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing queries that don't specify pagination parameters
- **FR-012**: System MUST document pagination capabilities and response size limits in tool descriptions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Pagination Metadata**: Information about the current page, total results, page size, and whether more results exist
- **Response Size Configuration**: Configurable thresholds for maximum response sizes, default limits, and maximum allowable limits
- **Query Parameters**: User-specified pagination controls including page number, offset, limit, and optional field selection

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A query for 1000 school records returns a response under 10,000 tokens (down from 4.4M tokens)
- **SC-002**: Default queries without limit parameters return exactly 20 records with pagination metadata
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully navigate through datasets of 10,000+ records using pagination
- **SC-004**: Response generation time for paginated queries is under 3 seconds for datasets under 1000 total records
- **SC-005**: 100% of queries that would previously exceed 100K tokens now stay under 10K tokens with default settings
- **SC-006**: Users can retrieve complete datasets by making multiple paginated requests, with each request completing successfully
- **SC-007**: Field selection reduces response size by at least 50% when requesting 3 fields from endpoints with 10+ available fields

## Assumptions

- The Urban Institute Education Data API supports limit and offset parameters for pagination (verified from API documentation)
- Users making queries through MCP servers understand basic pagination concepts
- A default page size of 20 records provides sufficient data for most analytical tasks while staying well under token limits
- The maximum limit of 1000 records balances between allowing batch processing and preventing token overflow
- Compact JSON (without indentation) is acceptable for programmatic consumers (AI agents, not human readers)
- Response size can be reasonably estimated by counting records and average field sizes
- The underlying API's data structure is stable enough that field selection won't break frequently

## Dependencies

- No external service dependencies beyond the existing Urban Institute Education Data API
- No changes required to MCP client implementations (backward compatible enhancement)
- Testing requires realistic dataset queries to validate token counts and pagination behavior

## Out of Scope

- Streaming responses (future enhancement)
- Caching of paginated results (future enhancement)
- Compression of response payloads (future enhancement)
- Aggregation or summarization of large datasets (already exists via get_education_data_summary tool)
- Custom response formats (CSV, XML, etc.) - only JSON is supported
- Rate limiting or query throttling (separate concern)
